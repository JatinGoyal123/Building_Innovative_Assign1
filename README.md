# RoadDataset-TimeSeriesPrediction
This Project help in performing time series prediction on Road Dataset.

## Aim-
To predcit Parameter 9-13 from the given dataset for each Section.

### Methodology Adopted-
We use Train and Test split strategy , by extracting every tenth year data for parameters 9-13 for every section.
Applied Extra Regressor Model to implent random forest and predict the values and RMSE.
